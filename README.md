# Something About Me

Im an Industrial Automation Technologist with a passion for developing innovative and efficient IoT solutions. I graduated from the University of Santiago of Chile in 2019 and obtained a Diploma in IoT Specialization from the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaíso in 2023.

I worked as an IoT Specialist for 2 years. There, I was responsible for designing and creating electronic circuits, PCBs, and 3D prototypes, configuring and programming microcontrollers, developing and designing front-end applications with React JS, and designing IoT architectures based on technologies such as LoRa, Sigfox, WiFi, BLE, and 4G. I was also an integrator of Libelium equipment in Chile, a globally recognized brand for its IoT products.

My core competencies include industrial control, instrumentation, electronic circuit design, microcontroller programming, and web development. I consider myself a proactive, creative professional, constantly seeking learning and improvement.

My goal is to continue growing as an IoT specialist and provide value to my team and clients with high-quality, impactful solutions.
